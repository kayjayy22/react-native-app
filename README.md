# React Native Mobile App Project 📱

Hey there! Welcome to our React Native Mobile App Project 🚀. This repository is your playground for building an awesome mobile app using React Native. We've split the project into two exciting tasks that let you flex your React Native muscles.

## What's Cookin'?

This project is all about creating a nifty React Native mobile app that demonstrates basic authentication, data fetching from a groovy API, smooth navigation, and hey, if you're up for it, some extra bells and whistles 🎉.

## Task 1: Simple React Native App 🌟

Kick things off by building a slick login screen with a sprinkle of basic authentication magic.

### Here's the deal:

- Cook up a login screen with these ingredients:

  - Ingredients 🥚: Username and password input fields
  - Special sauce 🍔: A "Login" button

- Stir in some authentication goodness:

  - Mix in a dash of hardcoded username and password for flavor
  - Voilà! Flash an alert that says "Login successful" on a successful login 🎊
  - Oopsie-daisy? For failed logins, display an alert saying "Login failed"

- Spicing it up (Optional):
  - If you're feeling fancy, season with a pinch of styling to make the login screen pop! 🎨

## Task 2: Fetch and Display Data 📥

Level up the app by adding data fetching from an API and some extra zing in user interaction.

### Ready to roll:

- Prepare a fresh screen to show off a list of posts from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts).

  - Dish out each post's title and body with style!

- Sizzle with screen navigation:

  - When users tap a post, whisk them away to a screen with all the juicy post details 🍔.

- Time to spice it up, again! Add a "Refresh" button:

  - Let users give the list of posts a shake by fetching fresh data from the API

- Master Chef move: Whip up a few unit tests:
  - Let's see your skills! Cook up some tests to ensure everything's as tasty as it looks 🧪

## Bonus Features (Optional) 🎁

If you're up for some extra kitchen action, consider these bonus ingredients:

- Handling mishaps like a pro:

  - Serve up user-friendly error messages when there's trouble fetching API data 🚫.

- Extra serving of awesomeness: Pull-to-refresh functionality:
  - Treat your users with a fancy pull-to-refresh feature for the list screen 🌬️.
